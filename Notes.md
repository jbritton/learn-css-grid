## Why CSS Grid
- Easier to create two dimensional layouts
- Simpler HTML markup - grid is defined in CSS rather than HTML element nesting
- Flexible - especially with responsive media queries.  Elements can be switched to different rows based 
on a media query (this is much difficult when using a nested element approach like Bootstrap)
- Skip framework dependencies
- Supported by all major browsers
